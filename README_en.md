## Introduction
Using this fluid particle system, you can quickly simulate 2D fluids such as water, magma, and oil with different textures.\
The system supports generating a large number of particles and can be used on mobile platforms.\
By utilizing the `Render Graph` framework, it only requires a single main camera and renders fluid particles via `GPU Instance`.\
Compared with the traditional method of rendering to a Render Target using a separate camera, the rendering efficiency is greatly improved.
